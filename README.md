"I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.  I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else."

Answer:
Q1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage? (for example, a glowing button is more discoverable then a swipe-left gesture)
  I will add a pencil button icon right next to the trash can,its easy for the user to figure it out because a pencil icon is known around the world for being an edit icon
  and since there will be a pencil icon next to each todo,the user will know tht this means to edit the TODO row.
Q3. how hard to implement will your solution be?
  its not hard at all, just need to add a pencil Icon in the RowToDo xml and the recycleview will do the rest.
Q5. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?
 it is very consistent because a pencil is icon is famous for editing in the web and app UI world.
